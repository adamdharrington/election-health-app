Uplift Election 2016 Health Map Application
=================================


This app is part of the Uplift.ie election 2016 health campaign. Thanks goes to Storyful for creating an amazing API to access candidate information. As the API is CORS blocked, data has been pulled stubbed directly into the app with the hope of requesting it once access headers are made available.

Steal
--------------------

Feel free to steal what you want, the svg constituency map was made in Illustrator based on these boundaries [Irish Political Maps][ipm]. 

Google Form Backend
----------------

We're using a handy endpoint from a google form response spreadsheet as a backend; If you want to plug in something similar be aware most articles on the subject are dated but stackoverflow has a workaround.
